\begin{abstract}
The following investigate options to remove empty structures and MC-chunks.
Empty structures and MC-chunks are allowed in PDF so it is not strictly necessarly to remove them, but they aren't so nice.

Such structures can be created by the automated tagging, for example if a paragraph has started and the following structure directly closes it again.
