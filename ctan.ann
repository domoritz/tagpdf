Version 0.98 [2022-12-22]

### Added 
 - started with dedicated latex name spaces
 - namespaces definitions have been externalized and are now read from files.   
 - rules to check if a tag is allowed as child in the current structure. If not allow
   a warning is issued, more messages can be activated with log=v. 
 - The data for namespaces and rules are in a new module, tagpdf-data.dtx.
 
### Changed 
 -  adding a new tag with add-new-tag now requires that the target role is 
    defined. Unknown roles error. 
 -  RoleMap object is no longer written in PDF 2.0 as it uses namespaces
 -  in pdf < 2.0 rolemaps are resolved to the PDF standard.   
 -  Structure destinations are used in PDF < 2.0 too -- they don't harm and
    can improve html export.
 -  \tagmcbegin no longer requires to use the tag key: the value from the surrounding
    structure will be used.
