Version 0.98i [2023-06-14]

### Added
 - lua backend: added function to update attributes in a box.
 - new keywords struct `struct_abs` and `mc_abs` for `\tag_get:n`.
 - \tag_if_box_tagged:N to allow to test if stored boxes have tags.
 - \tag_mc_box_reset:N to reset the attributes in a box (lua mode).
 - a definition for \newlabeldata is provided in the aux-file to ease
   switch between tagged and untagged documents.
   
### Fixed
 - tagging of header/footer if fancyhdr is used: tagging is now correctly stopped.
