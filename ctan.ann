Version 0.96 [2022-08-06]

### Fixed
 - \tag_get:n{struct_num} works now correctly in nested structures, and
   can be used if only tagpdf-base has been loaded.

### Changed
 - ref key can be used more than once and collect the values
 - alttext key has been renamed to alt, the older name is provided as alias
 - faster processing by avoiding type look up in pdftex and luatex
 - more commands are now provided by tagpdf-base.sty 

### Added
 - \tag_struct_object_ref:n to reference the object ref of a structure.
 - a key parent to allow structures to choose their parent structure.
 - setup option paratag, which allows to change the tag name used for the
   automatically tagged paragraphs.
 - \tag_start:, \tag_stop:n and \tag_start:n to stop and start tagging for
   example in trial typesetting.
