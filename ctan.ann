Version 0.93 [2022-01-13]

## Added 

  - key `root-AF` which allows to add associated files to StructTreeRoot
  - support for structure destination. They will be added automatically 
    if the engine supports them and the pdf version is 2.0 (unless they are actively suppressed).
  
## Fixed

 - Value of /AF should be an array
 - setting the meta key activate-all to false didn't work
 
## Removed 
 - `\tagpdfifluatexT`, `\tagpdfifluatexTF`, `\tagpdfifpdftexT`. 
    Use iftex or the expl3 commands instead.
